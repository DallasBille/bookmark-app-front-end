## About the Project

Markador is a web article/blog post bookmarking tool. With it, you can upload articles from around the web into one interface. This consolidates different articles and allows you to organize them in a multitiude of ways, as well as allows you to add notes after reading them.

## Motivation

After growing sick of chrome's bookmark tool and lack of customization, I whipped up a five day React and Rails prototype of a tool that will help you organize your blog articles, and allow you to add notes to articles you have read, and creates a more personal UX than chrome bookmark's.

## Technologies:

Markador uses React with a Rails backend and vanilla everything else. It has reusable components for organization.

## Back End:

https://github.com/DallasBille/bookmark-app

## Set Up:

1. Clone Repo.
2. npm install.
3. npm start.

This launches the front end, make sure you have the back end set up so you can save your own articles!

## To-Do's:

1. Better UX/UI (Cleaner article form).
2. Redo read/unread feature.
3. Ability to create a category.
4. Chrome Dev tool that download pertinent info automatically.
5. Cleaner note feature and imporoved CSS.
